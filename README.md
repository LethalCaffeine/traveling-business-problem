## Setup

Pre-requisites:

- Docker for Desktop üê≥

First, you will need to build a docker image from the dockerfile in the root project folder.

```sh
docker build -t <image-name> .
```

After the image has been built, use docker run to start a container. Execute the following command to start the Express server in development mode.

```sh
docker run -it -p 3000:3000 --name <container-name> <image-name> npm run dev
```

Open up a new tab in your web browser, and go to localhost:3000/mapping.

## Visualizations

This was my first visualization of US Census data! It depicts the average annual household income in 2018 for each Census tract geometry, which is the smallest denomination of reporting groups. Red blocks represent average household income over 50,000 dollars a year. Blue blocks represent average household income under 50,000 dollars a year.
